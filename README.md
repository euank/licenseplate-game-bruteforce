============================

Consider this a personal repo likely to be of no value to anyone else. Move
along.

The game can be found described
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_numberplate_game#In_Europe) (presently
it is the 4th paragraph).
In my family, the rule was always "Shortest and alphebetically earliest is
best", so I proceeded with that assumption.

Multiple solutions are here; I'm basically just committing them as backup since
I don't like losing data, even if it's not really important.

If you'd actually like to run any of this code, I recommend "solve.rb" which is
the only one to use a reasonably efficient algorithm and to have reasonably
readable code. The others were written when I was younger. They also all assume
`/usr/share/dict/words` exists on your system and contains the desired
dictionary.
