licenseplate-game-bruteforce
============================

Consider this a personal repo likely to be of no value to anyone else. Move
along.

The game can be found described
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_numberplate_game#In_Europe) (presently
it is the 4th paragraph).
In my family, the rule was always "Shortest and alphebetically earliest is
best", so I proceeded with that assumption.

It may be run with `ruby solve.rb`. Whatever dictionary is present at
`/usr/share/dict/words` will be used.
